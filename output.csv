To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level."

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level."

The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

As one, Rowena bangs on the glass window of the cottage and Welby screams a call to arms, waking those inside. The others pour out of the Burrfoot household and the combat is begun."

"October 27, 2022 10:27PM","DM (GM):","Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into. At 2nd level you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn=E2=80=99t have a flying or swimming speed. You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics=E2=81=A0 of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature=E2=80=99s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can=E2=80=99t use them. When you transform, you assume the beast=E2=80=99s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn=E2=80=99t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren=E2=80=99t knocked unconscious. You can=E2=80=99t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn=E2=80=99t break your concentration on a spell you=E2=80=99ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you=E2=80=99ve already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can=E2=80=99t use any of your special=E2=81=A0 senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment=E2=81=A0 functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature=E2=80=99s shape and size. Your equipment=E2=81=A0 doesn=E2=80=99t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment=E2=81=A0 that the new form can=E2=80=99t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment=E2=81=A0 that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form."

The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

The sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 3 pounds. Holes of various sizes dot its surface, allowing you to peer inside. The sphere is completely empty while a creature isn't attuned to it. While you're attuned to the sphere and it's on your person, ordinary rats, giant rats, and swarms of rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. The sphere contains a special demiplane made for rats. If a creature is attuned to the sphere at dawn, or the first time a creature attunes to the sphere each day, it magically summons a swarm of rats to the demiplane within. The rats can peer through the demiplane and see outside of the sphere through its various holes. You can use an action while holding the sphere to speak one of its three command words as described below. To do so, the sphere must have a swarm of rats inside it."
"February 21, 2023 10:49PM","Silm=C3=A4rotte:","Summon Giant Rat. When you speak the first command word, the swarm of rats coalesces into a giant rat, which magically appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This giant rat has 24 hit points and is friendly to you and your companions. It shares your initiative but takes its turn immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command the rat (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the rat takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the rat to the sphere's demiplane, at which point it becomes a swarm again. It then regains all its hit points. If the rat is reduced to 0 hit points, it and the swarm that created it disappear. Swarm Tether. When you speak the second command word, you also throw the sphere at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the swarm of rats exits the sphere and clings to the creature, forcing that creature to make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 piercing damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, it's also grappled until the start of its next turn. The creature repeats this saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute or until it succeeds three times, at which point the swarm scatters and disappears. If the sphere misses the creature when you throw it, the action is wasted, but the swarm remains inside the sphere. Visage of the Wererat. When you speak the third command word, the swarm inside the sphere disappears, but you gain the following benefits for 1 hour: =E2=80=A2 You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. =E2=80=A2 You have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet instead. =E2=80=A2 You can use an action to transform into a giant rat (as if by the polymorph spell) or revert back to your normal form. You retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores while in giant rat form. If you're reduced to 0 hit points while in giant rat form, you revert to your normal form and can't transform again in this way for the remainder of the effect."

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level."

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice: The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long. The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies."
